## Key Performance Parameters

Understanding transducer specifications:

!!! info "Frequency"
    The operating frequency determines resolution and penetration depth. Higher frequencies provide better resolution but limited range.

!!! info "Bandwidth"
    Bandwidth determines the range of frequencies the transducer can effectively transmit or receive. Wider bandwidth enables shorter pulses and better resolution.

!!! info "Sensitivity"
    The efficiency of converting electrical energy to acoustic energy (and vice versa). Higher sensitivity means better signal-to-noise ratio.

!!! info "Beam Pattern"
    The directional characteristics of the acoustic beam. Can be optimised for focusing, broad coverage, or specific angular patterns.
