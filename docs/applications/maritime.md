# Maritime Applications

Advanced sonar and ultrasonic solutions for maritime and underwater operations.

## Overview

The maritime environment presents unique challenges for acoustic systems. We provide specialised solutions for underwater detection, communication, and navigation across commercial, defence, and research applications.

## Key Maritime Applications

### Underwater Detection & Imaging

Advanced sonar systems for object detection and visualization:

- **Side Scan Sonar** - High-resolution seabed imaging
- **Multi-Beam Sonar** - Bathymetric mapping and seafloor characterization
- **Forward Looking Sonar** - Navigation and obstacle avoidance
- **Synthetic Aperture Sonar** - Ultra-high-resolution imaging

### Navigation & Positioning

Precise underwater positioning systems:

- **USBL (Ultra-Short Baseline)** - Versatile positioning for ROVs and divers
- **LBL (Long Baseline)** - High-precision large-area positioning
- **SBL (Short Baseline)** - Mid-range positioning applications
- **Acoustic Beacons** - Reference markers for navigation

### Underwater Communication

Reliable acoustic data transmission:

- **Acoustic Modems** - Digital underwater communication
- **Point-to-Point Links** - Direct communication channels
- **Network Systems** - Multi-node underwater networks
- **Emergency Communication** - Diver and submarine communication

### Maritime Security

Detection and surveillance systems:

- **Harbor Protection** - Intrusion detection and monitoring
- **Perimeter Security** - Protected zone surveillance
- **Underwater Threat Detection** - Mine and diver detection
- **Asset Protection** - Infrastructure security

## Technical Challenges

### Environmental Factors

The underwater acoustic environment is complex:

!!! warning "Variable Sound Speed"
    Water temperature, salinity, and pressure create sound speed variations that affect propagation and must be compensated.

!!! warning "Multipath Propagation"
    Surface and bottom reflections create multiple signal paths, causing interference and detection challenges.

!!! warning "Ambient Noise"
    Sea state, biologics, and shipping create background noise that limits detection range.

### System Requirements

Maritime systems must address:

- **Range vs Resolution** - Trade-offs between detection range and spatial resolution
- **Power Constraints** - Limited power availability on autonomous platforms
- **Reliability** - Operation in harsh marine environment
- **Data Management** - High data rates from imaging systems
