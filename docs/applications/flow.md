# Flow Measurement

Precision ultrasonic flow measurement solutions for industrial and utility applications.

## Overview

Ultrasonic flow meters provide accurate, reliable flow measurement without moving parts or pressure drop. They're ideal for a wide range of liquids and gases in pipes from small to very large diameters.

## Flow Measurement Technologies

### Transit-Time Flow Meters

Measuring time difference of sound propagation:

**Principle**: Sound travels faster downstream than upstream. The time difference is proportional to flow velocity.

**Applications**:

- Clean liquids
- Custody transfer
- Water and wastewater
- Chemical processing
- Food and beverage

**Advantages**:

- High accuracy (±0.5% or better)
- Wide turndown ratio
- No pressure drop
- No moving parts
- Bidirectional measurement

### Doppler Flow Meters

Measuring frequency shift from moving particles:

**Principle**: Sound reflected from particles or bubbles in the flow is frequency-shifted proportional to velocity.

**Applications**:

- Liquids with suspended solids
- Wastewater and slurries
- Mining and mineral processing
- Pulp and paper
- Food processing

**Advantages**:

- Works with opaque liquids
- Handles entrained air/gas
- Non-invasive installation
- Cost-effective
- Rugged and reliable

## Installation Types

## Key Performance Factors

### Accuracy & Repeatability

Factors affecting measurement quality:

- **Pipe Condition** - Wall thickness, material, liner
- **Fluid Properties** - Viscosity, temperature, particle content
- **Flow Profile** - Straight pipe requirements, flow disturbances
- **Installation Quality** - Sensor alignment, coupling, mounting
- **Calibration** - Initial and periodic calibration

### Operating Range

Understanding measurement capabilities:

!!! note "Turndown Ratio"
    The ratio of maximum to minimum measurable flow. Transit-time meters typically offer 100:1 or greater.

- Minimum flow velocity
- Maximum flow velocity
- Accuracy vs flow rate
- Reynolds number effects

### Environmental Considerations

Operating conditions matter:

- Temperature range (fluid and ambient)
- Pressure rating
- Hazardous area classification
- Vibration and shock
- EMI/RFI immunity
