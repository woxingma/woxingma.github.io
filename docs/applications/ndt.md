# Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

Ultrasonic inspection solutions for quality assurance and asset integrity management.

## Overview

Non-destructive testing enables inspection and evaluation of materials and components without causing damage. Ultrasonic testing is one of the most versatile and widely used NDT methods.

## NDT Capabilities

- **Lack of Fusion** - Weld defects

### Thickness Measurement

Precise material thickness gauging:

- **Corrosion Monitoring** - Wall thickness assessment
- **Manufacturing QC** - Production thickness verification
- **Asset Management** - Structural integrity monitoring
- **Multi-Layer** - Individual layer thickness measurement

### Material Characterization

Material property assessment:

- **Grain Structure** - Microstructure analysis
- **Mechanical Properties** - Elastic modulus, strength indicators
- **Residual Stress** - Stress state measurement
- **Material Identification** - Alloy verification
